# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-13)

**Core value:** The user opens the app (or gets a Telegram message) and immediately knows what's happening with *their* stocks — real holdings, real prices, real news — without digging through noise.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Auth + RLS Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 7 (Auth + RLS Foundation)
Plan: 1 of 4 in current phase (01-01 complete)
Status: In progress — CODE-ONLY / DEFER-VERIFICATION mode (no Docker, no live Supabase)
Last activity: 2026-07-14 — Completed 01-01-PLAN.md (Supabase config, migrations, RLS write-hole fixes, env scaffolding)

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 25%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 7-phase strict-downward dependency order (auth → schema → prices → import/alerts → news → digest), converged on by all four research files.
- [Roadmap]: Two hardest-to-reverse choices front-loaded — instrument identity is ISIN+exchange (Phase 2) and holdings modeled as a transactions ledger (Phase 2), before import/prices build on them.
- [Roadmap]: ALRT-04 (significant-news Telegram alert) mapped to Phase 6, not Phase 5 — it needs news matching and reuses the Phase 5 outbox.
- [Roadmap]: AI (Gemini) is always a second pass — price/news pipelines must work on raw data before summarization is layered on.
- [Phase 01]: Phase 1 runs in CODE-ONLY / DEFER-VERIFICATION mode: no Docker and no live Supabase, so stack start, live migration apply, and real-key capture are deferred; .env.local holds labeled placeholders.

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- REQUIREMENTS.md header stated "36 total" but the enumerated v1 IDs total **39** (AUTH 6, PORT 7, PRICE 7, IMPT 5, NEWS 5, ALRT 5, DGST 2, WIRE 2). Traceability count corrected to 39/39; header wording left for the user to confirm.
- Research flags for phase-time verification: Vercel Hobby function-duration + pg_cron→pg_net ergonomics (Phase 3), Groww XLSX / Robinhood CSV real layouts (Phase 4), exact Gemini free-tier RPD + Finnhub US-only (Phase 6).
- [RESOLVED via decision] Plan 01-01 Task 3 was blocked by missing Docker. Superseded by the CODE-ONLY / DEFER-VERIFICATION decision — no Docker/live DB used. DEFERRED work carried forward: `supabase start`, applying migrations against a live DB, verifying RLS enforcement, and capturing real anon/service-role keys. Must be done before Phase 1 verification can pass.
